# Earthquake Tracker

A Earthquake Tracker Map application build as part of the Coursera OOP and Data Structure in Java course (See: https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-java.)
 
I would like to thank the instructors (Prof. Christine Alvarado, Prof. Mia Minnes, and Prof. Leo Porte), the contributing organizations (Univercity of California San Diego and Google), and the people of Coursera for creating this (and many other) great course which has allowed me to complement my collegiate education with self-driven projects that have improved my knowledge and skills as a Sofware Developer/Programmer/Computer Scientist.
